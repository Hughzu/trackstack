			<h1>Welcome to TrackStack</h1>
			
			<p>
				I'm a software engineer with 8 years of experience transitioning into SRE/DevOps. 
				This blog documents my journey building <strong>TrackStack</strong> - a personal tracking 
				platform that evolves from scrappy MVP to enterprise-grade architecture.
			</p>

			<h2>Why This Exists</h2>
			<p>
				Ideas are worthless without execution. I have daily frustrations - expense tracking, 
				heat consumption monitoring, recipe management, calorie counting - that I could solve 
				with code. But premature optimization kills projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				So I'm building pragmatically: validate the problem first, use it daily, then invest 
				in architecture. <strong>Business first, technology second.</strong>
			</p>

			<h2>The Journey</h2>
			<p>
				TrackStack evolves through five phases, each documented here:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Scrappy MVP - Astro + Angular micro-frontends, daily validation</li>
				<li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Pragmatic Backend - C# monolith with hexagonal architecture</li>
				<li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Observability - Logging, metrics, and sustainable monitoring</li>
				<li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Enterprise-Grade - Microservices, multi-AZ, event-driven architecture</li>
				<li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> Multi-Cloud - Rebuilding on Azure to prove cloud-agnostic thinking</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
			<p>
				This isn't a tutorial series. It's real-world architectural evolution with honest 
				documentation of successes, failures, and trade-offs. You'll see:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How to validate ideas before over-engineering them</li>
				<li>Pragmatic cost-conscious infrastructure decisions</li>
				<li>Event-driven patterns and domain-driven design in practice</li>
				<li>The right way to evolve from monolith to microservices</li>
				<li>Modern DevOps: IaC, OIDC, observability, and FinOps</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Follow Along</h2>
			<p>
				The code is open source on <a href="https://github.com/Hughzu/trackstack/">GitHub</a>. 
				Each blog post dives deeper into specific architectural decisions, implementation details, 
				and lessons learned.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> I'm a young dad working in the messy middle of life. 
				This is a marathon with nap-time interruptions, not a sprint. And that's perfectly fine.
